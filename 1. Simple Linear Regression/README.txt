#SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

Hello and welcome to this hands-on guided project on simple linear regression. In simple linear regression, we predict the value of one variable Y based on another variable X. X is called the independent variable and Y is called the dependent variable. This guided project is practical and directly applicable to many industries.

##PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Perform data cleaning, feature engineering and visualization
Build, train and test a simple linear regression model in Sklearn
Understand the theory and intuition behind simple linear regression models

##PROJECT STRUCTURE:

This hands on project is divided into following tasks:

TASK 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

TASK 2: IMPORT LIBRARIES AND DATASETS

TASK 3: PERFORM DATA VISUALIZATION

TASK 4: CREATE TESTING AND TRAINING DATASET

TASK 5: UNDERSTAND THEORY BEHIND SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

TASK 6: TRAIN A SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL IN SCIKIT LEARN

TASK 7: EVALUATE TRAINED SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL IN SCIKIT LEARN
